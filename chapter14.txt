Non-Blocking I/O: The slow system calls are that block caller forever.
Non -Blocking I/O lets us issue an I/o operation, like open,read, or write and not let it block forever.
If the operation can not be completed , the calls returns immediately with an error noting that the operation would have blocked.
In in any program issues number of write calls more than needed to write the data then rest just return an error. This type of loop, called polling, is a waste of CPU time on a multiuser system.

Record locking: suppose more than one pprocess is trying to write some data to the same file, then it will create some kind of ambiguity.
To avoid this kind of problem record locking is used.
it is ability of a process to prevent other processes from modifying a region of a file while the first process is reading or modifying that portion of the file.
